Welcome to my Audible Audiobook Trends Portfolio Project! In this project, I analyzed the evolving landscape of audiobooks, analyzing various trends related to popular titles, authors, pricing, and user ratings. Through comprehensive data analysis, I aimed to uncover significant patterns and insights that reveal how the audiobook market has transformed over time. Leveraging tools like Excel, MySQL, and Tableau, this project provides valuable information for authors, publishers, and audiobook enthusiasts, offering a deeper understanding of the dynamics shaping the audiobook industry.

### **Project Scope**

The focus of this project is to delve into the trends and dynamics of Audible audiobooks over time. By examining various aspects such as popular audiobooks, notable authors, pricing patterns, and user ratings, I aim to provide in-depth insights into the audiobook market. This analysis will shed light on the factors influencing audiobooks' success and listeners' evolving preferences.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before beginning exploration, I cleaned and preprocessed the data, addressing missing values/nulls, and inconsistencies, converted the prices from IDR to USD, appropriately split the ratings and stars given into their columns, updated the date formatting, and removed the unnecessary information in the author and narrator columns.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is an essential step in uncovering patterns and relationships within the data. I reveal significant trends and correlations through visualizations and statistical summaries, offering a comprehensive understanding of the audiobook market overtime.


## Insights and Conclusions

Based on the findings from the analysis, I present a series of critical insights and conclusions. These conclusions are designed to offer a deeper understanding of the international debt scenario and its implications for various stakeholders.

## Visualizations and Reports

I've presented the findings through interactive visualizations, charts, and dashboards made in Tableau. 


## Key Questions Explored

1. **TWho do we owe all this money to?**
2. **Can a debt load of three times GDP ever be sustainable?**
3. **Is ther any responsible way to reduce this debt?**
4. **What could go wrong if we can't**
