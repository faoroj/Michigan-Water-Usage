Welcome to my Audible Audiobook Trends Portfolio Project! In this project, I analyzed the evolving landscape of audiobooks, analyzing various trends related to popular titles, authors, pricing, and user ratings. Through comprehensive data analysis, I aimed to uncover significant patterns and insights that reveal how the audiobook market has transformed over time. Leveraging tools like Excel, MySQL, and Tableau, this project provides valuable information for authors, publishers, and audiobook enthusiasts, offering a deeper understanding of the dynamics shaping the audiobook industry.

### **Project Scope**

This project focuses on analyzing water usage trends across various industries in Michigan from 2013 to 2022. By examining detailed data on water withdrawals from different sources—Great Lakes, groundwater, and inland surface water—this project aims to provide insights into the water consumption patterns and dependencies of different industry sectors. The analysis will highlight significant trends, identify high water-use industries, and explore potential conservation strategies. This comprehensive study will aid policymakers, environmentalists, and industry stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding water resource management in Michigan.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before exploring, I converted all the gallons of water columns to billions to simplify my numbers.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is an essential step in uncovering patterns and relationships within the data. I reveal significant trends and correlations through visualizations and statistical summaries, offering a comprehensive understanding of counties, industries, water usage throughout the years.


## Insights and Conclusions

Based on the findings from the analysis, I present a series of critical insights and conclusions. These conclusions are designed to offer a deeper understanding of the international debt scenario and its implications for various stakeholders.

## Visualizations and Reports

I've presented the findings through interactive visualizations, charts, and dashboards made in Tableau.

## Key Questions Explored

1. **What are the overall trends in water usage across all industries in Michigan from 2013 to 2022?**
2. **Which industries are the largest consumers of water in Michigan?**
3. **How does water usage from different sources (Great Lakes, groundwater, inland surface water) compare across industries?**
4. **What are the annual trends in water usage from each source (Great Lakes, groundwater, inland surface water)?**
